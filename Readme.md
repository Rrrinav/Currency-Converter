## Introduction

Welcome to the Currency Converter project for the third semester of the IWT (Internet and Web Technologies) course.

- **Dynamic Currency Selection:** Users can select currencies from a dropdown list, and corresponding flags are dynamically updated based on the selected currencies.

- **Real-time Exchange Rates:** The application fetches real-time exchange rates from a currency API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions.

- **Bidirectional Conversion:** Users can convert from one currency to another and vice versa with just a few clicks.

- **Visual Representation:** The project includes a simple chart to visually represent the currency exchange rates.
